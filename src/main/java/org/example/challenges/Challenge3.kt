/*
* Write a program that shows how a tennis game goes and who won it.
* The program will receive a sequence consisting of "P1" (Player 1) or "P2" (Player 2), depending on who
* win every point of the game.
*
* - The scores of a game are "Love" (zero), 15, 30, 40, "Deuce" (tie), advantage.
* - Given the sequence [P1, P1, P2, P2, P1, P2, P1, P1], the program would display the following:
* 15 - Love
* 30 - Love
* 30 - 15
* 30 - 30
* 40 - 30
* Deuce
* P1 advantage
* He has won P1
* - If you want, you can control errors in data entry.
* - Consult the game rules if you have questions about the points system.
